# Maintenance and verification review

Date: 2026-10-25. Environment: Linux, Python 3.12, Node.js 24. This review describes the inspected default-branch snapshot plus the changes in this branch. Existing open feature PRs are separate work and are not represented as merged.

## Changes

Documentation maintenance: added a project overview, source-download instructions, runtime/setup guidance and a clearly labeled architecture illustration. No application functionality was changed in this repository by this maintenance pass.

Inspected source tree: `df1166ae12c53874b04bb826070f818846bbbdb1`. Runtime checks apply to that source snapshot plus the bounded repairs described above.

## Executed checks

| Check | Observed result |
| --- | --- |
| `python -m pytest -q tests` | 4 passed |

## Limits and next validation

Only the listed checks were executed. Live services, external AI models, hardware, authenticated accounts, representative performance/accessibility studies and production operations require their own acceptance evidence. A successful build or unit suite is not proof that every feature is production-ready.

## Integration

This is a reviewable maintenance branch. Review its diff and repository CI before merging. No deployment, release publication, model-score claim or automatic merge is part of this pass. Reverting the branch changes removes this maintenance work without a database migration.
